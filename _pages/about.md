Hello! I am a university lecturer with a Ph.D. in tectonics, specializing in the geology of the Northwest Pacific and East Asian continental margins. Since completing my doctorate in 2019, my research has focused on topics such as dyke emplacement mechanisms, paleotectonic and paleogeographic reconstruction of Northeast Asiaâ€™s continental margins, and simulating geomorphological evolution in Mars' Jezero Crater. Here, I share insights from my research, as well as broader explorations into Earth's and Mars' dynamic geological history. Welcome!
